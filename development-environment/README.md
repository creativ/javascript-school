# Development Environment

## Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a great editor for working with JavaScipt (even working with anything).
Sublime Text 3 available for download: [download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Sublime Text support a lot of plugins for customization and improvement your development experience. You'll need to install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) for using those plugins: [installation guide Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). *NOTE: After Package Control installation you'll need to restart sublime.*

### Sublime Text Plugins

So, you have Package Control installed and able to go with new plugins. To install plugin make next steps:

1. Open Sublime Text and press `ctrl+shift+p` (Win, Linux) or `cmd+shift+p` (OS X)
2. Type: `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Type name of plugin to install (e.g. from list below) and press `enter`

List of recommended plugins:

- **Git** -- helpers for git
- **GitGutter** -- shows diff for currently editing file
- **SCSS** -- SCSS syntax highlight
- **Babel** -- JavaScript (Babel) syntax highlight
- **EditorConfig** -- keep same indentation level in whole project
- **Emmet** -- helpers for markup creation
- **SublimeLinter** -- lint your files and helps to keep good code style
- **Oceanic Next Color Scheme** -- cute colour scheme for code

## Node.js

Node.js is JavaScript runtime for running JavaScript outside of browser. Mostly used in back-end development.
To install Node.js download it and go through steps described on official website: [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).

## Chrome Plugins

To make Chrome Developer tools more comfortable to work with React, I recommend to install next plugins:

- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
