# Development Environment

You need great tools to get great results, so let's take a look at what is necessary:

- *Version Control System* (Git etc.) -- keep control of your code changes
- *Editor* (Sublime Text, Vim etc.) -- edit you code in comfortable environment
- *Debug Tools* (React Developer Tools etc.) -- helps you to find out problems in your code

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) solves problem of working on projects in a team. Git is distributed version control system which helps you to share your works with the world and work together on the same project (even same files) in a team. It will solve your problems for tracking changes in code and merging them togheter.

Follow next guide to install Git: [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
