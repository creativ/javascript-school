# Development Environment

You need great tools to get great results, so let's take a look what is necessary:

- *Version Control System* (Git etc.) -- keep control of your code changes
- *Editor* (Sublime Text, Vim etc.) -- edit you code in comfortable environment
- *Debug Tools* (React Developer Tools etc.) -- helps you find out problems in your code

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) solves problem of working on projects in team. Git is distributed version control system which helps you to share you works with world and work together on the same project (even same files) in a team. It will solve your problems for tracking changes in code and merging them togheter.

Follow next guide to install Git: [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Sublime Text

**Sublime Text** is a great editor for working with JavaScipt (even working with anything).
Sublime Text 3 available for download: [download Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Sublime Text support a lot of plugins for customization and improvement your development experience. You'll need to install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) for using those plugins: [installation guide Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). *NOTE: After Package Control installation you'll need to restart sublime.*

### Sublime Text Plugins

So, you have **Package Control** installed and able to go with new plugins. To install plugin make next steps:

1. Open Sublime Text and press `ctrl+shift+p` (Win, Linux) or `cmd+shift+p` (OS X)
2. Type: `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Type name of plugin to install (e.g. from list below) and press `enter`

List of recommended plugins:

- **EditorConfig** -- keep same indentation level in whole project
- **Emmet** -- helpers for markup creation
- **SublimeLinter** -- lint your files and helps to keep good code style

## Node.js

**Node.js** is JavaScript runtime for running JavaScript outside of browser. Mostly used in back-end development.
To install Node.js download it and go through steps described on official website: [installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).

## Chrome Plugins

To make Chrome Developer tools more comfortable to work with React, I recommend to install next plugins:

- [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
